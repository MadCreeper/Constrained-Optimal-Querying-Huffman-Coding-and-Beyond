\section{Greedy Algorithms Based on GBSC}

\subsection{Basic Structure}

The basic idea of the algorithm is shown below. In practice, the most difficult part is how to find the best question (line 2). However, since usually $|\mathscr{A}|$ is small and $\mathscr{A}$ has a simple structure, this process is often very simple. This is especially the case when we deal with the Battleship problem later.

% 	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
%     \State initialize the initial dataset $data$
% 	 \Procedure{binary}{x}
% 	        \If {the length of $x$ is 1}
% 	                \State \Return $x$
% 	        \EndIf
%             \State initailize empty array $temp$
%             \For{every $i \in x$ }
%                     \State add $data[i]$ to $temp$
%             \EndFor
%             \State $s \gets $ sum of numbers in $temp$
%             \For{every $i \in temp$ }
%                     \State $i \gets i / s$
%             \EndFor
%             		\State the sum of probability of exons between $u$ and $v$ is closest to 0.5
%             		\If{target exon is between $u$ and $v$ }
%             		        \State $x \gets$ $x[u:v]$
%             		\Else 
%             		        \State $x \gets$ $x[:u] + x[v:]$
%             		\EndIf
%             \State \Return \Call{binary}{$x$}
%      \EndProcedure
% 	\end{algorithmic}

	\Procedure{GBSC}{node, p}
	    \State choose question $X \in \mathscr{A}$ that makes the left and right subtrees most average
	    \State $p_1 \gets$ the possibilities in condition that the question is true
	    \State \Call{GBSC}{$root.left, p_1$}
	    \State $p_2 \gets$ the possibilities in condition that the question is false
	    \State \Call{GBSC}{$root.right, p_2$}
    \EndProcedure
	\State read $p$, where $p[i]$ is the probability of $i$
	\State initialize $root$
	\State \Call{GBSC}{$root, p$}
	\end{algorithmic}
